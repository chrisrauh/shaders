# Getting started w/shaders in Three.js

A mini series written on [unicornsfartpixels.com](https://www.unicornsfartpixels.com). Mostly for my own learning, but it might prove helpful for others who are curious about getting started with shaders and integrating data into their projects.

This tutorial series specifically covers audio data, and develops off of a previous series about [visualising sound](https://www.unicornsfartpixels.com/posts/2018-01-01fftthree/)

* [part1](https://www.unicornsfartpixels.com/posts/2018-03-15shaders-pt1/): set a render target
* [part2](https://www.unicornsfartpixels.com/posts/2018-04-01shaders-pt2/): create a custom shader
* [part3](https://www.unicornsfartpixels.com/posts/2018-05-10shaders-pt3/): animate a custom shader w/data
